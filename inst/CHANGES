The first version of the ismev package was Version 1.0,
constructed on 2002/11/25. The changes that have occured
in subsequent versions are given below.


Version 1.1 (2003/11/25):

If the profile likelihood functions gev.prof or gev.profxi 
calculated the likelihood at a point where the shape 
parameter was at or very close to zero the functions would 
error due to a mistake in the R port. This has been fixed.
The Maintainer thanks Simon Brown for reporting this bug.
