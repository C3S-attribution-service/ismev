The first version of the ismev package was Version 1.0,
constructed on 2002/11/25. The changes that have occured
in subsequent versions are given below.

Vesion 1.2 (2006/03/10):

The column name "Sea Level" in the portpirie and fremantle
datasets has been changed to "SeaLevel" to prevent problems
with inclusion in formula arguments to functions in other
R packages. The Maintainer thanks Thomas Yee for this
suggestion.
 
The maintainer address has changed.

Version 1.1 (2003/11/25):

If the profile likelihood functions gev.prof or gev.profxi 
calculated the likelihood at a point where the shape 
parameter was at or very close to zero the functions would 
error due to a mistake in the R port. This has been fixed.
The Maintainer thanks Simon Brown for reporting this bug.
